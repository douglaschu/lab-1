# lab-1
This was my very first assignment at Grand Circus. Ah, memories! 

I had to copy a screenshot of a web page in HTML and CSS the best I could and make the page responsive. 
I had fun tinkering with the spacing in CSS to get the proportions as close as possible. 
Bonus points if you get the Strong Bad Email reference I used as the lorem ipsum text. 

Made with VS Code.
